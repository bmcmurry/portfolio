                  This was a group project with myself and three others. It was
                  my second project and was designed as a command line program.
                  My team and I created this to automate a payment schedule and
                  record expenses to excel ready <strong>CSV files</strong> for
                  our class food budget. My work on this program was to handle
                  the recording of the <strong>date</strong> when the user
                  logged in, saving the data to the <strong>CSV files</strong>,
                  creating the file containing the collection of
                  <strong>users</strong>, and recording the
                  <strong>expenses</strong> to the date decided by the user and
                  adjusting the balance.

                  This project was the first one I ever made. I've learned a lot
                  about coding since this project. My team and I designed this
                  command line project to implement our understanding of
                  <strong>lists</strong> and <strong>dictionaries</strong> in
                  Python. We created this project to guide and expedite the
                  creation of a <strong>D&D</strong> character. This program has
                  a large collection of data for the customization of the
                  character. I worked on the
                  <strong>random number generator</strong>, as well as applying
                  all of the modifiers to the character based on the selections
                  made during character creation.

                  This is a project I worked on by myself. This was the first
                  full <strong>Django</strong> application I created. The
                  website has two functions. <strong>First</strong> it allows
                  customers to view a menu and place orders for themselves.
                  <strong>Second</strong> it allows the manager of the website
                  to edit the menu, view all orders, and manage customers.
                  During creating this website I learned how to manage data
                  using a <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database. I also learned
                  how to verify usernames and passwords using models and take
                  inputs for images that will be saved to the database.

                  This was my second project using <strong>Java</strong> and the
                  first time I created an app using <strong>Springboot</strong>.
                  This app creates a RestfulApi that you can visit in a url once
                  ran to view and edit a <strong>JsonObject</strong>. The app
                  has three data points that are associated with each other:
                  vehicle, owner, and maintenance records. At this point I had
                  become more comfortable calling <strong>APIs</strong> and
                  managing a larger application size.

                  <strong>weekly time series</strong> data displaying prices for
                  that stock. The app allows the user to save stock to their
                  account and saves the price upon doing so to view trends and
                  see if the stock goes up or down. I used several of
                  <strong>AlphaVantage's</strong> API endpoints to verify my
                  stock data. I used the API to get the price and also cross
                  reference the stock to another endpoint to verify the stock
                  is still valid.

                  This was a group project. This website allows the user to
                  create custom business cards based off of our collection of
                  templates. I was responsible for the
                  <strong>Backend</strong>. My responsibilities also included
                  creating the login and registration as well as creating most
                  of the html pages and views for the base site. I designed the
                  site to allow the user to create a business and contact
                  information for that business. During this project I became
                  more familiar with <strong>Middleware</strong> and how to pass
                  data to and from <strong>Forms</strong>.
